# Dazzling Fractals
In this lab, you will play around with one of the most popular types
of computer art...the fractal!

A fractal is a geometric shape where each part has the same
statistical characteristic of the whole.  There are a lot of examples
of fractals, and the most beautiful ones are computer generated.
While they may look complex, they are really just recurrent iterations
of very simple properties.  They may be drawn using points, lines, or
sometimes even geometric shapes.  

In this lab, you will be drawing three fractals.  The starter program
provides the basic interface, and it is up to you and your partner to
provide the code that draws the fractals.  Feel free to experiment,
for instance you may want to create an interface which allows the user
to specify the parameters of the fractal to be generated.  You may
also want to play with animation.  If you do extra work, I will award
extra points to the programming assignments category of your grade.

Also, for this lab we will be exploring the agile methodology of pair
programming.  

This lab will be done in the following stages:

1. Find a partner and view the Pair Programming Video.
3. Select a Fractal.
4. Get the starter program running in an environment of your choosing.
5. Change the button text to match the fractals you are using. 
6. Implement your fractals.
7. Push everything back to GitHub.

## Pair Programming
The first thing to explore in this lab is pair programming.  We will
be using this on a few other labs this semester, and it really does
make the time go faster.  The basic idea is that you will have two
programmers using one computer.  One programmer is the "driver" (the
one doing the coding) and the other one is the "navigator".  The
navigator reads the code as the driver is coding and offers
suggestions and advice.  Throughout a pair programming session, each
person trades roles.  For a more complete introduction to this coding
technique, please see the video: https://youtu.be/A6kdFdJp4jY

## Selecting Your Fractals
Many possibilities exist for which fractals you can draw.  Some are
easier than others, but they are all achievable with a little bit of
effort.  Some use points, some use lines, they are all a lot of fun!
Some examples of possible places to look for guidance on how to
generate the fractals are found below:

* Mandelbrot Set: https://gist.github.com/GiorgioRegni/571688
* Julia Set: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set
* Hilbert Curve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve
* Koch Snowflake: http://www.csc.twu.ca/rsbook/Ch18/Ch18.4.html
* Sierpinski Triangle: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sierpinski-triangle/
* Other Fractal Ideas: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal

You can select any of these, or find your own if you have a favorite.

## Change Your Button Text
This step is pretty self explanatory.  Simply change the text on the
buttons to reflect your fractals' names.


## Implement Your Fractals
By default, the code provided in this lab simply draws colored boxes.
You want to modify the fractal pane drawing functions so that they
draw your fractals instead.  You should just have modify those three
functions, you can leave the rest of the program alone (unless you
choose to do some extra work, of course).  

Please do study the rest of the program to understand how it works,
however.

## Push Everything to Github
Be sure to put both your names in the fractals.cpp file.  You will
only need to push one copy, however feel free to upload to both of
your repos.
